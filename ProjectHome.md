VisiGraph is a free, flexible, cross-platform application for modeling graph theory problems and solutions, complete with an online repository of named graphs and extensible framework for scripting generators and dynamically-evaluable functions in Java.  VisiGraph supports not only simple graphs, but also multigraphs, pseudographs, digraphs, trees and every logically-consistent combination thereof, with additional support for vertex- and edge-level properties such as weight, label, and (numerical) color.
